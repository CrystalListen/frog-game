# Game - Frog Cross River
===============================

## What's this?

This is the first project of the Udacity Fronted(Advanced) Nanodegree Arcade Game, which is mainly for teaching the students to write object-oriented JavaScript code.

## How to run this?

One of the easiest way to get this project up and running is to serve the 'index.html' file in the root to a specific local port through static servers so that you can visit. I used the 'http-server' written in NodeJS but feel free to use any others as you like or are more familiar to.

Make sure you have 'npm' or 'yarn' installed globally in your machine. If not, please reference the following sections to install them.

Having npm/yarn installed gloablly and correctly, please run the following commands to start the game:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
cd game-river #Make sure you run the following command in the project root
http-server -c-1 -o # -c-1 disables caches, -o will open the browser right after server started -c-1
```

### How to install npm globally?
* Install through the archives: Go to the [Node.js official](https://github.com/creationix/nvm),or reference [this article](https://www.digitalocation.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-with-nvm-node-version-manager-on-a-vps)

### How to install yarn gloablly?

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

This requires a globally installed npm.
