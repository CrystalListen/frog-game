/* 
 *
 * This file provides the function of the game control Center, controller is a single example object for other modules to call.
 * Most of the code related to Game logic is written here, and any game element wants to know when to build it,
 * Or when you encounter an event, ask Controller. So you can interpret controller as the housekeeper of this game.
 *
 * Specifically, the controller has several functions:
 * 1. Control game start, pause, resume, reboot, etc.
 * 2. Keep the logical cycle of the game, creating new elements, or raising the level of the enemy, which can stop and restart
 * 3. Additions and deletions of game elements, but this part of the interface is not exposed, called by the internal function
 * 4. Provides an API for dealing with game events, including logic after encountering enemies and treasures
 * 5. Notifies Dommanager to update DOM elements as the player's game progresses
 * 6. Provides a two-dimensional array object Pavement, which represents the occupancy of the middle area of the screen and can be accessed externally
 *
